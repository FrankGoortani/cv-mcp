# CV-MCP Docker Image Update: Fixed Ping Mechanism

## Summary

This update (v1.0.4) includes critical improvements to the ping mechanism in the HTTP server to prevent container crashes:

- Implemented a robust error handling system in the ping mechanism that prevents unhandled errors from crashing the container
- Enhanced the ping interval system with proper error isolation
- Added exponential backoff for failed pings to reduce system stress
- Implemented a recovery system that automatically resets the ping interval after successful pings
- Added comprehensive logging for better diagnostics and monitoring

## Docker Image

The updated Docker image has been built and pushed to Docker Hub under the following tags:

- `frankgoortani/cv-mcp:1.0.4` - Specific version
- `frankgoortani/cv-mcp:fixed-ping` - Descriptive tag indicating the fix
- `frankgoortani/cv-mcp:latest` - Latest version

## Deployment Instructions

### Using Docker CLI

```bash
# Pull the fixed image
docker pull frankgoortani/cv-mcp:fixed-ping

# Stop and remove any existing container
docker stop cv-mcp-server || true
docker rm cv-mcp-server || true

# Run the container with proper settings
docker run -d \
  --name cv-mcp-server \
  --restart always \
  --platform linux/amd64 \
  -p 3001:3001 \
  -v /path/on/host/media:/usr/src/app/media \
  -e NODE_ENV=production \
  -e PORT=3001 \
  -e REQUEST_TIMEOUT=120000 \
  -e PING_INTERVAL=60000 \
  frankgoortani/cv-mcp:fixed-ping
```

### Using Docker Compose

Update your `docker-compose.yml` file:

```yaml
version: '3'
services:
  cv-mcp:
    image: frankgoortani/cv-mcp:fixed-ping
    platform: linux/amd64
    container_name: cv-mcp-server
    restart: always
    ports:
      - "3001:3001"
    volumes:
      - /path/on/host/media:/usr/src/app/media
    environment:
      - NODE_ENV=production
      - PORT=3001
      - REQUEST_TIMEOUT=120000
      - PING_INTERVAL=60000
```

Then run:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

## Verification

After deployment, you can verify that the container is running correctly by:

1. Checking the container status:
   ```bash
   docker ps -f name=cv-mcp-server
   ```

2. Viewing the logs to confirm proper operation:
   ```bash
   docker logs cv-mcp-server
   ```

3. Testing the health endpoint:
   ```bash
   curl http://your-server-ip:3001/health
   ```

## Technical Details

The key fix in this update addresses the ping mechanism in `http-server.ts`, which was previously causing container crashes due to unhandled errors. The new implementation:

1. Wraps all ping operations in try-catch blocks to prevent error propagation
2. Implements a safePingServer function that isolates the core ping functionality
3. Uses Promise.race with timeouts to prevent blocking operations
4. Incorporates exponential backoff to adapt to unstable conditions
5. Implements proper cleanup of timers to prevent memory leaks

This update ensures that even if the ping mechanism encounters errors, they are properly captured, logged, and handled without crashing the container.
